# Turing Machine Compiler

This project is a purely academic (read: useless) system to get a subset of C to compile to a turing machine. It builds upon some earlier work I've done with turing machine ruleset generation, and on the idea behind a Universal Turing Machine.

## Filetypes

* .tr0 / .turing
* .tr1
* .tr2
* .tr3
* .tasm

## Machine Structure

The structure of the turing machine that is to run the compiled C code is specialized to some extent.

The machine has three symbols, despite being an essentially binary machine, with "2" acting primarily as a delimiter.

The machine has five tapes, each with a specific purpose:
* Input Tape
* Output Tape
* Program Tape
* Scratch Tape
* Working Tape
